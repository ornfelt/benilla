/// - `sync` is the step where the entity-entity mapping between the main and render world is updated.
///   This is run on the main app's thread. For more information checkout [`SyncWorldPlugin`].
/// - `extract` is the step where data is copied from the main world to the render world.
///   This is run on the main app's thread.
/// - On the render thread, we first apply the `extract commands`. This is not run during extract, so the
///   main schedule can start sooner.
/// - Then the `rendering schedule` is run. See [`RenderSystems`](crate::RenderSystems) for the standard steps in this process.
/// - In parallel to the rendering thread the [`RenderExtractApp`] schedule runs. By
///   default, this schedule is empty. But it is useful if you need something to run before I/O processing.
/// - Next all the `winit events` are processed.
/// - And finally the `main app schedule` is run.
/// - Once both the `main app schedule` and the `render schedule` are finished running, `extract` is run again.
