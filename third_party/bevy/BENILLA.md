# benilla's vendored Bevy: what it is, and how to check it

Upstream: [`bevyengine/bevy`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy), MIT OR Apache-2.0, version
`0.18.1` (and `bevy_mikktspace` `0.17.0-dev`, the version 0.18.1 depends on), the versions the
workspace lock resolved to. Beside it, in `third_party/bevy-plugins/`, the Bevy plugins benilla
builds, at their locked versions: [`avian3d`](https://github.com/Jondolf/avian) `0.6.1` with
`avian_derive` `0.2.3`, [`bevy_heavy`](https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_heavy) `0.4.0`,
[`bevy_transform_interpolation`](https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_transform_interpolation) `0.4.0`
(all MIT OR Apache-2.0) and [`bevy_egui`](https://github.com/vladbat00/bevy_egui) `0.39.1` (MIT,
dev builds only). Every one is wired in through `[patch.crates-io]` in the workspace root, the way
`kira` and `lua-src` are, so every Bevy crate the build compiles, on any target, is one of these.

## Why a copy exists at all

benilla is being moved onto a Bevy of its own that implements only what benilla uses, with the
same API, so that its code and structure stay exactly as they are (Phase A of `c-port-plan.md`).
This copy is the starting point: each crate is then trimmed to what benilla reaches, every cut a
deletion or a simplification that keeps behaviour (the same system order, change ticks, command
application, message lifetimes, observer and hook timing, asset events). The recorded frame,
`crates/benilla-app/src/game_plugins/frame.txt`, pins the schedule the copy must keep producing.

## What was copied

Each crate is copied from the cargo registry as published: `Cargo.toml` (the registry's
normalized one), `src/`, `README.md`, the licence files, and the files `src/` includes from
outside it (`bevy/docs/`, `bevy_color/docs/`, `bevy_math/images/`). Left out: the registry's
bookkeeping (`.cargo-ok`, `.cargo_vcs_info.json`, `Cargo.lock`, `Cargo.toml.orig`), the
`examples/`, `benches/` and `tests/` the manifests name but nothing here builds, and the
repository files (`.github/`, `.gitignore`, `.cargo/`, lint and format configs, `CHANGELOG.md`,
`CONTRIBUTING.md` and the like). `avian_derive` publishes no licence files; it has `avian3d`'s,
the same repository's.

Four crates stay in `Cargo.lock` from crates.io and are never compiled: `bevy_audio`,
`bevy_dev_tools`, `bevy_feathers` and `bevy_ui_widgets`, optional dependencies of `bevy_internal`
behind features benilla leaves off. They leave the lock when `bevy_internal` is trimmed.

## How to check

Until a crate's trim lands, it is byte-identical to the registry crate:

```sh
R=~/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f
diff -r -q $R/bevy_ecs-0.18.1 third_party/bevy/bevy_ecs
```

prints only the files left out above. After a trim, `git log -- third_party/bevy/<crate>` is
what changed and why.
