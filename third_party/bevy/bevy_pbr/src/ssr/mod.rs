/// Add this component to a camera to enable *screen-space reflections* (SSR).
///
/// Screen-space reflections currently require deferred rendering in order to
/// appear. Therefore, they also need the [`DepthPrepass`] and [`DeferredPrepass`]
/// components, which are inserted automatically,
/// but deferred rendering itself is not automatically enabled.
///
/// SSR currently performs no roughness filtering for glossy reflections, so
/// only very smooth surfaces will reflect objects in screen space. You can
/// adjust the `perceptual_roughness_threshold` in order to tune the threshold
/// below which screen-space reflections will be traced.
///
/// As with all screen-space techniques, SSR can only reflect objects on screen.
/// When objects leave the camera, they will disappear from reflections.
/// An alternative that doesn't suffer from this problem is the combination of
/// a [`LightProbe`](bevy_light::LightProbe) and [`EnvironmentMapLight`]. The advantage of SSR is
/// that it can reflect all objects, not just static ones.
///
/// SSR is an approximation technique and produces artifacts in some situations.
/// Hand-tuning the settings in this component will likely be useful.
///
/// Screen-space reflections are presently unsupported on WebGL 2 because of a
/// bug whereby Naga doesn't generate correct GLSL when sampling depth buffers,
/// which is required for screen-space raymarching.
